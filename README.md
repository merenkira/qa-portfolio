# QA Portfolio – Kira Merenkova

This repository showcases my work as a QA Engineer.

I am transitioning into QA from an operations & product background and I’m currently completing a professional **Manual + Automation QA program**.  
Here I collect clean, practical examples of my QA work – both **training projects from the course** and **real freelance/commercial tasks**.

## What you’ll find here

- **Manual testing examples**
  - Test cases and test suites for typical web and mobile features  
  - Bug reports with clear steps, severity/priority and expected behaviour  
  - Test plans, checklists and small pieces of test documentation  
  - Examples from both course assignments and real freelance projects  

- **(In progress) Automation & tools**
  - Basic UI and API automation projects using **Cypress**  
  - Small practice tasks for **JavaScript** and test frameworks  
  - Experiments with **Postman**, CI/CD and cloud test environments  

All examples are based on training environments, demo applications and real client work (where sharing is allowed and does not expose any sensitive data).
